array is 0 - 7
merge sort first call 0 , 3, 7
	merge sort (left) 0, 1 ,3 
		merge sort (left) 0, 0 ,1
			merge sort (left) 0,0,0 //start unraveling
				merge (do nothing it is one)
			merge sort (right) 1,1,1 //realized mid needs to be low + high before /2
				merge (do nothing it is one)
			merge current "array" is just 0 and adding 1 0+1 is start of new array so check if low < mid + 1
		merge sort (right)2,2,3
			merge sort (left) 2,2,2 //start unraveling
				merge(do nothing it is one)
			merge sort (right) 3,3,3 
				merge (do nothing it is one)
			merge leftOneTooAdd= items[low] rightOneTooAdd = items[mid +1]
